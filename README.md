*MAC Changer Hiding Identification And Transposing OUIs*

## What

`macchiato` is a Bash script that assigns a random [MAC address] to specified network interfaces. It is meant to run at boot time.

Its twist is that the MAC addresses it assigns to network interfaces is limited to a few [OUI] prefixes. A MAC address's first 3 bytes indicates the manufacturer of the hardware, as defined by the [IEEE's OUI registry]. As such, attempting to randomize this part of the MAC address by simply picking a random sequence of 3 bytes uniformly results very often in MAC addresses that aren't registered to any publicized OUI, which is a very strong indication that the user is using a [spoofed MAC address][MAC spoofing].

Trying to be smarter about it by restricting the subset of 3-byte sequences to registered OUIs only is a good step, but many of the companies associated with those OUIs are obscure, and often have gone bankrupt or have manufactured very few chips. As such, seeing a MAC address from them is almost certainly a giveaway that the user is using a spoofed MAC address.

`macchiato` lets you define which network interfaces you want to use a spoofed MAC, and which classes of OUI prefixes the random MAC addresses should use. For example, you can restrict your laptop's onboard wireless interface to only be assigned MAC addresses that are actually found in laptop wireless chips.

## Why

If you need reasons as to why spoofing your MAC address can be a good thing, [read this blog post on the subject][MAC spoofing: What, why, how, and something about coffee] or [the Wikipedia article about it][MAC spoofing].

If you need reasons as to why you should use this over manual configuration or `machchanger`, you shouldn't. This script uses `iproute2` to do the actual MAC address assignment. The only thing you get out of it is control over the prefix of the MAC addresses assigned to each interface. This yields more believable spoofed MAC addresses. It also lets you define a blacklist of OUI prefixes you never want to see assigned to your network interface.

## How

### Install it

#### The Arch way:

	$ yaourt -S macchiato-git

#### The other way:

	$ git clone git://perot.me/macchiato
	$ sudo macchiato/install-systemd-service.sh

### Configure it

	$ sudo cp /etc/macchiato.d/{example.sh.sample,wlan0.sh}
	$ sudo $EDITOR /etc/macchiato.d/wlan0.sh

The `example.sh.sample` file you just copied should contain all the information you need.

### Run it

	$ sudo systemctl start macchiato

### Like it? Add it to your boot process

	$ sudo systemctl enable macchiato
